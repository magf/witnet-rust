A. Build helper images
B. Build binary for aarch64 and x86_64
C. Push a multi-architecture docker image with buildx

1. Bridge workflow completely separate from main workflow
2. Only triggers when the tag has -bridge in it
3. Avoid matching versions between binary & docker image in rc releases
4. For non RC releases follows the same paradigm pruning the bridge from the tag itself
5. Avoid pulling from github releases & find a way to inject respective binaries (artifacts from previous stages)
6. No releases on github for the bridge
7. Main releases update the latest tag as well
